# Nuclear_Neural_Hybrid_Mass_Model
Physics-informed sequential residual neural network framework for nuclear mass modelling. This Model uses the existing mass models as the "Major Adjustment Knob" and the neural network predictions as the "Minor Adjustment Knob" for predicting the mass excess values for nuclei.
